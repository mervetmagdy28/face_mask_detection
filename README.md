##Face Mask Detection Flutter 
##App README

#Welcome to the Face Mask Detection Flutter App! This app utilizes machine learning to detect whether individuals in a given image are wearing face masks or not. The app employs the TensorFlow Lite package for running the machine learning model, the Camera package for capturing images in real-time, and the Image Picker package for selecting images from the device's gallery.

#Features
*Real-time face mask detection using the device's camera.
*Face mask detection on images from the device's gallery.
*Fast and efficient inference using TensorFlow Lite.
*User-friendly interface to capture and select images.
*Visual indicators for mask detection results.
*Easy-to-extend architecture for future improvements.

#Dependencies
The app utilizes the following Flutter packages:

*tflite: This package is used to run the TensorFlow Lite model for face mask detection.

*camera: The camera package enables access to the device's camera for capturing real-time images.

*image_picker: This package provides the ability to select images from the device's gallery.

Make sure to refer to the pubspec.yaml file for the specific version of each package used.

#Model
The face mask detection model used in this app is trained to distinguish between images with people wearing masks and those without. The model has been converted to TensorFlow Lite format for efficient inference on mobile devices.

The model file (model.tflite) is included in the app's assets directory.
